I"Ø<p>I came to Edmonton in the late ninties and started to produce art in several different mediums, metals was one of them.
I worked as an artist at my home in the medium of using various metals both found
and repurposed to create a variety of images that spread from the comical to the
serious to the political. Sometimes a single object would give me an idea right
away and others came later as I accumulated various metals from the scrap yards
and eventually found a repurpose for them. I suppose my mood was also a factor
in what I would create at the time of inspiration but, to be honest, ideas were
so common I couldnâ€™t possibly do them all so priority would take place with the
available time between work and art.</p>
