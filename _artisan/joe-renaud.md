I came to Edmonton in the late ninties and started to produce art in several different mediums, metals was one of them.
I worked as an artist at my home in the medium of using various metals both found
and repurposed to create a variety of images that spread from the comical to the
serious to the political. Sometimes a single object would give me an idea right
away and others came later as I accumulated various metals from the scrap yards
and eventually found a repurpose for them. I suppose my mood was also a factor
in what I would create at the time of inspiration but, to be honest, ideas were
so common I couldn't possibly do them all so priority would take place with the
available time between work and art.

 Some of the metal objects are recognizable
to some but not always because many of these objects are either so old many people
today wouldn't recognize them and others were so unknown I had to figure out what
they were for myself. I decided to mesh together metals that normally an artist
would never put together due to the level of difficulty that would be imposed with
each other. Such as cast irons with copper, or brass with steel. Or all of them
together in one piece. Also, some carving was involved with coppers or steels
depending on my desired effect. Surrealism is what most people would categorize
my art in but it's a hybrid really of the surreal and the abstract to a degree.
You may also notice I can use paint on some of my sculptures which enhanced them
for the desired overall appeal. I like colors and so colors I got in spades. It
would be fair to say I produced 90% of all the metals sculptures for myself knowing
they may not appeal to others. In total, I produced about 160 metals sculptures
over a 10 year period and I vowed to myself I'd either get to 500 sculpture or ten
years, whichever came first. 2010 was the last year I produce a metal sculpture.
What you see now is the remainder of what is left.
