The Abundance Room is the 1st room at the top of the stairs.
It features a pillow top queen size bed, a shelf full of interesting books,
and a brown suede couch that doubles as a pull out bed to accommodate two extra
guests. Relax amidst the warm, peach colored walls and north and east facing
windows that welcome the morning sun.
